Me: Why does my app crash with a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable? 
AI: This happens when your code tries to access elements like data['weather'][0], but data is 
None. This usually means the API call failed and returned None, but your code didn't handle 
it before trying to use the result.

Me: How can l fix this?
AI: Always validate the response before using it.
