Me: Why is the plot function failing with KeyError: 'Avg Temp(Â°C)'?
AI: The DataFrame might not have the expected column name due to missing or mismatched 
data in the API response or the transformation step. 

Me: How exactly do I go about fixing this?
AI: Ensure that your transformation function (weather_to_dataframe) creates the right 
column. You can also check the column names before plotting.
