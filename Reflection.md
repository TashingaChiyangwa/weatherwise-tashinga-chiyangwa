# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
For the Weather Advisor project, I focused primarily on ChatGPT and its role as an AI support tool. 
ChatGPT was crucial to my development, expansion, and improvement of my Python code. ChatGPT helped 
elevate general logic to modular and scalable functions, aided with API integration and handling 
JSON responses, as well as visualizing the weather data using matplotlib. ChatGPT assisted me with 
identifying better practices for validating inputs, properly working with exceptions, and applying 
pandas specifically for tabular data. Further, ChatGPT assisted me in designing a natural language 
interface, improving how the user interacted with the application with a more conversational query. 
This was incredibly valuable in making the application more interactive and user friendly.

## Prompting Techniques
During the project, I consciously employed prompting techniques to get the most out of ChatGPT. For 
example, when requesting code generation or debugging support, I used clear, sequential, and step-by-step 
instructions. To tackle complex tasks, I broke them down into smaller units, and when I asked for 
code improvements, I framed the prompt with specific target outcomes (for example, "add error handling,
" or "increase readability," or "add comments") and then iteratively sought to refine the underlying logic 
by posing follow-up questions. This enabled me to get more accurate and contextualized assistance. I would also 
prompt for explanations when introducing new libraries like pandas, to ensure I understood the rationale 
behind code suggestions.

## What Worked Well?
One thing I am especially proud of is how modular and user-friendly the final application was. The use of 
pandas to handle and process weather data afforded me the opportunity to do some neat analysis, such as determining 
the warmest, coldest, or most comfortable day for outdoor activities. I also created visualizations of temperature 
and precipitation trends to provide a better context for the forecast, as well as to better help users interpret the 
information. The conversational AI user interface also made it feel intuitive and interactive.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Had I more time, I would have done more to extend the API function to allow for medium-range forecasts or hourly 
predictions. I might also have investigated lengthier testing and debugging with unit tests and error logging. 
I think even if it is a working system as it is right now, it would be nice to perform some more rigorous testing 
strategy and writting better documentation to deploy to the App or share if I got help from someone else.

## Final Thoughts
In conclusion, this project has motivated me to think more critically about how I cannot just use AI to augment 
software development, but as a working partner in the design-thinking process to apply in my work going forward. 
This contributed to my thinking around creatively and innovatively solving design problems, it has also increased 
my confidence in building more interactive data-driven applications. It was an enriching project technically as well 
as personally.
